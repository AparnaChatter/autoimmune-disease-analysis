Caveats:
"1. About national population figures: population figures for 1999 are from the 1990-1999 series of bridged-race intercensal"
"estimates of the July 1 resident population; population figures for 2000 and 2010 are bridged-race April 1 census counts;"
"population figures for 2001-2009 are from the revised 2000-2009 series of bridged-race intercensal estimates of the July 1"
"resident population; population figures for 2011 are bridged-race postcensal estimates of the July 1 resident population, from"
"the Vintage 2011 series released by NCHS on July 18, 2012; population figures for 2012 are bridged-race postcensal estimates of"
"the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2012 series released by NCHS on June 13, 2013; population figures for 2013 are"
"bridged-race postcensal estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2013 series released by NCHS on June 26,"
"2014; population figures for 2014 are bridged-race postcensal estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2014"

"2. The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the estimates of the"
"resident population that is under one year of age. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Age Group."
"3. Changes to cause of death classification affect reporting trends. More information:"

"5. Circumstances in California resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of death code R99, ""Other"
"ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality"" for deaths occurring in years 2000 and 2001. Caution should be used in"
