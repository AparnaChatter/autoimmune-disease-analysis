Caveats:
"1. Due to confidentiality constraints, death counts and rates are suppressed when the number of deaths is less than 10. Figures"
"representing infant deaths and births have additional constraints for national and local data. More information:"

"2. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"

"3. About national population figures: population figures for 1999 are from the 1990-1999 series of bridged-race intercensal"
